# XOM-46: Frontend Console Errors on Vercel Deployment

## Summary
The frontend test on the deployed Vercel application (https://frontend-p7xtawit7-tuiizzyy-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app/) identified several console errors and authentication issues across multiple pages.

## Issue Details

### API Authentication Errors
- **Status**: Most critical issue
- **Error Pattern**: `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 ()`
- **Affected Routes**: `/api/server-tools`, `/api/servers/[id]`, `/api/servers/search`
- **Root Cause**: Missing or invalid authentication headers for Supabase service role key

### Vercel User Meta Errors
- **Status**: Secondary issue (likely Vercel-specific)
- **Error Pattern**: `Request Failed: https://frontend-p7xtawit7-tuiizzyy-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app/.well-known/vercel-user-meta - net::ERR_ABORTED`
- **Affected Pages**: All pages
- **Note**: These errors appear to be related to Vercel's own analytics/monitoring and may not directly affect functionality

### User Authentication Errors
- **Status**: Feature functionality issue
- **Error Pattern**: `Not signed in with the identity provider.` and `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 ()`
- **Affected Features**: User authentication functionality

## Analysis

### Critical Issues
1. **API Authentication**: The application is failing to authenticate with Supabase for API requests, resulting in 401 errors
   - This matches our earlier finding that the SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY environment variable needed to be added to Vercel

### Non-Critical Issues
1. **Vercel User Meta**: These errors appear to be Vercel platform-specific and don't directly impact application functionality
2. **User Authentication**: These errors are expected when not logged in and attempting to access authenticated routes

## Fix Plan

### Priority 1: API Authentication
1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Verify SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is properly set in Vercel environment variables
   - Check that the key is available to the API routes at runtime
   - Verify the environment variable is set for both Production and Preview environments

2. **API Route Updates**:
   - Review all API routes to ensure they properly use the service role key
   - Add proper error handling to display user-friendly messages when authentication fails
   - Implement a middleware approach to consistently apply authentication headers

### Priority 2: Error Handling Improvements
1. **UI Feedback**:
   - Add better error handling for API failures
   - Implement loading states and error states for all components that make API calls
   - Add a global error boundary to catch and display unexpected errors

2. **Logging & Monitoring**:
   - Add structured logging for API errors
   - Consider implementing error tracking (e.g., Sentry)

## Testing Plan
1. After implementing fixes:
   - Re-run the frontend test script
   - Manually verify each API route works as expected
   - Test with and without authentication

2. Regression Testing:
   - Verify all features continue to work as expected
   - Check performance hasn't been negatively impacted

## Estimation
- **Story Points**: 3
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Completion Time**: 1 day

## Additional Notes
- This ticket addresses issues found in the frontend tests run on June 1, 2025
- Test results and screenshots are saved in: `/reports/screenshots/frontend-test-2025-06-01T11-26-40.626Z/`
- All API authentication errors appear to be related to the same root cause
