Title: Fix MCP Tools Detection - Database Schema Issue

Description:
## Problem
The GitHub-based tools detection script is failing because it's attempting to update a non-existent column 'tools_count' in the servers table.

## Investigation Results
- The 'tools_count' column doesn't exist in the servers table
- 513 servers have GitHub URLs that could be processed for tool detection
- The current schema only allows storing results in 'last_tools_scan' and 'tags' columns
- No servers currently have tool tags

## Proposed Solution
1. Update the tools detection script to only use existing columns (last_tools_scan, tags)
2. Use tags to indicate detection success/failure and store tool names
3. After validation of the approach, consider adding a 'tools_count' column or a proper tools table

## Acceptance Criteria
- Script successfully updates the last_tools_scan field
- Script adds appropriate tags for detection status
- Script adds tool: prefix tags for detected tools (up to 10 per server)
- Detection success rate improves to at least 60%

// In a real implementation, this would use the Linear API to create the ticket
