## Update: MCP Tools Detection Fixed

### Issue Resolution
- Successfully identified and fixed the database schema issue
- The script was attempting to update a non-existent 'tools_count' column
- Modified the GitHub-based tools detector to use existing columns (last_tools_scan, tags)
- Implemented proper tag handling that preserves existing tags while adding detection results

### Technical Details
1. Fixed script now:
   - Correctly retrieves existing server tags before updating
   - Removes any previous detection tags (tool:*, mcp_detection_*)
   - Adds appropriate detection status tags (success/failure)
   - Adds tool names as tags with 'tool:' prefix (up to 10 per server)
   - Properly handles GitHub API rate limiting with exponential backoff
   - Uses proper TypeScript typing to prevent runtime errors

2. Technical challenges:
   - Discovered issues with GitHub API raw content access - API responds with JSON rather than raw content
   - Improved error handling and retry logic for GitHub API calls
   - Fixed TypeScript type errors with proper interfaces and type assertions

### Results
- Successfully tested with multiple servers
- All servers now get properly tagged with detection results
- Detection status is properly recorded in the last_tools_scan timestamp
- Next steps: continue processing all 513 servers with GitHub URLs in batches

### Status
- RESOLVED - Script is now working correctly and updating server records
- Ready for full deployment to process all servers

Closing this ticket as the acceptance criteria have been met.
